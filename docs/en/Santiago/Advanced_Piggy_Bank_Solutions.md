# 💰 SOLUTIONS - STRATEGIC PIGGY BANK 💰

**Grade:** 6th Grade (11-12 years)

---

## ✅ Exercise 1 - Complex Monthly Budget

**a) Distribution:**
```
Total: €45

Piggy bank (30%): 45 × 0.30 = €13.50
Snacks (25%): 45 × 0.25 = €11.25
Entertainment (20%): 45 × 0.20 = €9.00
Gifts (15%): 45 × 0.15 = €6.75
Emergencies (10%): 45 × 0.10 = €4.50

Verification: 13.50 + 11.25 + 9 + 6.75 + 4.50 = €45 ✓
```

**b) With €5 left over:**
```
Put it in the piggy bank (increase savings)
Total piggy bank: €13.50 + €5 = €18.50
```

**c) In 1 year:**
```
€13.50 × 12 months = €162
```

**Answers:** a) Distribution above; b) €18.50; c) €162/year

---

## ✅ Exercise 2 - Investment Analysis

**a) Time for each option:**

**Option A:** €650 ÷ €25/week = 26 weeks

**Option B:** €650 ÷ €80/month = 8.125 → 9 months (rounded)

**Option C:** €650 ÷ €50 every 2 weeks = 13 periods × 2 = 26 weeks

**b) Fastest option:** Options A and C tied (26 weeks = ~6 months)
But Option B has a bonus!

**c) Option B bonus (proportional to time):**
```
Total saved in 8 months: €80 × 8 = €640

Since the bonus is annual (5% per year), in 8 months you receive a fraction:
Proportional bonus: 5% × (8 months ÷ 12 months) = 5% × 0.6667 = 3.33%

Bonus: €640 × 3.33% = €640 × 0.0333 = €21.33
Total in 8 months: €640 + €21.33 = €661.33
```
**With the proportional bonus, you reach €661.33 in 8 months - already enough!**

**Final comparison:**
```
Option A: 26 weeks (~6 months) = €650 → FASTEST!
Option B: 8 months = €661.33 (with bonus)
Option C: 26 weeks (~6 months) = €650 → FASTEST!
```

**Final answer:**
- **Fastest:** Options A and C (6 months vs 8 months)
- **Advantage of Option B:** You receive €11.33 extra, but it takes 2 more months
- **Decision:** Depends on priority - speed (A/C) or extra return (B)

## ✅ Exercise 3 - Cascading Discounts

**a) After 1st discount (15%):**
```
€420 × 0.15 = €63 discount
€420 - €63 = €357
```

**b) After 2nd discount (10% of €357):**
```
€357 × 0.10 = €35.70
€357 - €35.70 = €321.30
```

**c) Total discount:**
```
€420 - €321.30 = €98.70
Percentage: (98.70 ÷ 420) × 100 = 23.5%

It's NOT 25%! It's less because the second discount applies to the already discounted value.
```

**d) How much you need:**
```
€321.30 - €180 = €141.30
```

**Concept:** Successive discounts don't add up directly!

---

## ✅ Exercise 4 - Proportional Division

**a) Division:**
```
You: 2/5 of €75 = €30
Friend A: 2/5 of €75 = €30
Friend B: 1/5 of €75 = €15

Verification: 30 + 30 + 15 = €75 ✓
```

**b) How much you need:**
```
€30 - €20 = €10
```

**c) Weeks:**
```
€10 ÷ €4/week = 2.5 weeks → 3 weeks
```

**Answers:** a) You and A: €30 each; B: €15; b) €10; c) 3 weeks

---

## ✅ Exercise 5 - Simple Compound Interest

**a) Month 2:**
```
€103 × 1.03 = €106.09
```

**b) Month 3:**
```
€106.09 × 1.03 = €109.27
```

**c) Month 6:**
```
Method 1: Multiply successively
€100 × 1.03^6 = €100 × 1.1941 = €119.41

Method 2: Step by step
Month 0: €100
Month 1: €103
Month 2: €106.09
Month 3: €109.27
Month 4: €112.55
Month 5: €115.93
Month 6: €119.41
```

**Answer:** Approximately €119.40

**Concept:** Compound interest grows exponentially!

---

## ✅ Exercise 6 - Savings Equations

**a) Equation:**
```
85 + (12 × 15) = x
or
85 + 180 = x
```

**b) Solution:**
```
x = 85 + 180
x = €265
```

**c) With 20% discount:**
```
Discounted price: €265 × 0.80 = €212
Left over: €265 - €212 = €53
```

**Answers:** a) 85 + 12×15 = x; b) €265; c) €53 left over

---

## ✅ Exercise 7 - Data Analysis and Averages

**a) Average:**
```
(42 + 38 + 55 + 45 + 40 + 60) ÷ 6 = 280 ÷ 6 = €46.67
```

**b) Median:**
```
Order: 38, 40, 42, 45, 55, 60
Median = (42 + 45) ÷ 2 = €43.50
```

**c) Range:**
```
60 - 38 = €22
```

**d) In 1 year:**
```
€46.67 × 12 = €560
```

**e) 37.5% above average:**
```
46.67 × 1.375 = €64.17

```

**Answer:** Use the coupon at Store D (final price: €54.50)

## ✅ Exercise 9 - Ratios and Proportions

**a) Parents' contribution:**
```
Ratio 3:1
If you save €60, parents give: €60 ÷ 3 = €20
```

**b) Total:**
```
€60 + €20 = €80
```

**c) To reach €240:**
```
Ratio remains 3:1
You: 3/4 of €240 = €180
Parents: 1/4 of €240 = €60
```

**d) Weeks:**
```
€180 ÷ €15/week = 12 weeks
```

**Answers:** a) €20; b) €80; c) €180; d) 12 weeks

---

## ✅ Exercise 10 - Annual Planning with Unexpected Events

**a) Real calculation:**
```
Plan: €810
March emergency: -€25
August bonus: +€30
Real total: €810 - €25 + €30 = €815
```

**b) Goal reached?** Yes! €815 > €800

**c) Percentage:**
```
(815 ÷ 800) × 100 = 101.875% ≈ 102%
```

**Answers:** a) €815; b) Yes; c) 102% of goal

---

## ✅ Exercise 11 - Probability and Decisions

**a) Buy A + C:**
```
€60 + €35 = €95
Left over: €150 - €95 = €55
```

**b) Buy A + B + C:**
```
€60 + €45 + €35 = €140
Left over: €150 - €140 = €10
```

**c) Best combination:**
```
Analysis by expected value of use:
A: 70% of €60 = high value (frequent use)
B: 30% of €45 = low value (rare use)
C: 90% of €35 = very high value (constant use)

Best: A + C (€95) - maximum use value, €55 left over
Avoid: B - low probability of use
```

**Answer:** A + C is the best option (guaranteed use + margin)

## ✅ Exercise 12 - Inflation and Value of Money

**a) In 3 months:**
```
€50 × 1.02^3 = €50 × 1.0612 = €53.06
```

**b) In 6 months:**
```
€50 × 1.02^6 = €50 × 1.1262 = €56.31
```

**c) Can you buy before €56?**
```
NO! Month-by-month analysis with €10/month:

Month 0: €0 | Price: €50.00
Month 1: €10 | Price: €51.00 (need €41.00 more)
Month 2: €20 | Price: €52.02 (need €32.02 more)
Month 3: €30 | Price: €53.06 (need €23.06 more)
Month 4: €40 | Price: €54.12 (need €14.12 more)
Month 5: €50 | Price: €55.20 (need €5.20 more) ← Still not enough!
Month 6: €60 | Price: €56.31 → Now you have enough, but it already exceeds €56!

Answer: NO, you cannot. When you finally have enough money (month 6 with €60),
the price has risen to €56.31, exceeding the €56 limit.
```

**Important lesson:** Inflation can prevent you from buying something if you save too slowly.
In this case, the price rises faster (2%/month) than you can save!

**d) Savings buying today:**
```
€56.31 - €50 = €6.31
```

**Concept:** Inflation erodes purchasing power!

## ✅ Exercise 13 - Savings Graph

**a) Period of greatest growth:**
```
Week 0-2: +€25
Week 2-4: +€35 ← Greater!
Week 4-6: +€25
Week 6-8: +€40 ← Even greater!

Answer: Week 6-8 (+€40)
```

**b) Average rate:**
```
Total growth: €175 - €50 = €125 in 8 weeks
Average: €125 ÷ 8 = €15.625/week ≈ €15.60
```

**c) Week 12:**
```
Additional growth: 4 weeks × €15.60 = €62.40
€175 + €62.40 = €237.40
```

**d) When €300:**
```
Missing: €300 - €175 = €125
€125 ÷ €15.60 ≈ 8 weeks
Week 8 + 8 = Week 16
```

---

## ✅ Exercise 14 - Conversion and Travel

**a) Euros needed (rate €1 = £0.85):**
```
£180 ÷ 0.85 = €211.76
```

**b) With new rate (€1 = £0.90):**
```
£180 ÷ 0.90 = €200
```

**c) Savings:**
```
€211.76 - €200 = €11.76
```

**d) Months needed:**
```
€211.76 ÷ €40/month = 5.29 → 6 months
```

**Concept:** Exchange rates significantly affect cost!

## 💡 Financial Reflection - Expected Answers

**1. Simple vs. compound interest:**

Simple interest: always calculated on the initial value
Compound interest: calculated on accumulated value (interest on interest)
Compound grows much faster!

**2. Importance of comparing prices:**

Different stores have different prices. Percentages help calculate real discounts and compare offers. Small differences accumulate over time.

**3. Inflation:**

Inflation makes prices go up, reducing purchasing power. Idle money loses value. That's why it's important to invest or buy before it gets more expensive.

**4. Emergency fund:**

Unexpected events happen (illness, equipment breakdown). Having a reserve (10-20%) prevents spending savings from important goals and provides security.
