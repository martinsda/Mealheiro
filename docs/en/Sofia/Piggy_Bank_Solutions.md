# 🐷 SOLUTIONS - MY PIGGY BANK WORKSHEET 🐷

**Grade:** 2nd Grade (7-8 years, advanced level)

---

## ✅ Exercise 1 - Savings Planning

**a) How much money do I still need to save?**
```
25 - 8 = 17 euros
```

**b) How many weeks will it take?**
```
17 ÷ 3 = 5.66... → 6 weeks (rounding up)
Or: 3 × 5 = 15 (2 missing) → 6 weeks
```

**Answers:** I need to save **17 euros** and it will take **6 weeks**.

**Explanation:** First we calculate how much is missing (subtraction). Then we divide by how much we save per week. Since it doesn't give an exact number, we need 6 weeks (in the 6th week we'll have enough money).

---

## ✅ Exercise 2 - Saving for Two Months

**a) In 1 month (4 weeks):**
```
6 × 4 = 24 euros
```

**b) In 2 months (8 weeks):**
```
6 × 8 = 48 euros
```

**Answers:** In 1 month I save **24 euros** and in 2 months I save **48 euros**.

**Explanation:** We use multiplication to calculate regular savings. 6 euros per week × number of weeks.

---

## ✅ Exercise 3 - Comparing Prices

**a) Cheapest store:**
```
Store A: 32 euros
Store B: 28 euros ← The cheapest!
Store C: 35 euros
```

**b) Savings:**
```
35 - 28 = 7 euros
```

**Answers:** The cheapest store is **Store B** and I save **7 euros**.

**Explanation:** Comparing prices is important! Whenever possible, we should look for the best option.

## ✅ Exercise 4 - Sharing the Piggy Bank

**a) Half of 24 euros:**
```
24 ÷ 2 = 12 euros
```

**b) How much stays saved:**
```
12 euros (the other half)
```

**Answers:** I will spend **12 euros** on the book and **12 euros** stay saved.

**Explanation:** Half means dividing into 2 equal parts. 24 ÷ 2 = 12.

---

## ✅ Exercise 5 - Three Goals

**a) Total cost:**
```
12 + 8 + 15 = 35 euros
```

**b) How much more I need:**
```
35 - 10 = 25 euros
```

**Answers:** I need to save **25 euros** in total.

**Explanation:** First we add all the goals. Then we subtract what we already have.

---

## ✅ Exercise 6 - The Allowance

**a) Savings per week:**
```
10 - 4 = 6 euros
```

**b) In 6 weeks:**
```
6 × 6 = 36 euros
```

**Answers:** I save **6 euros** per week and in 6 weeks I save **36 euros**.

**Explanation:** We subtract what we spend from the total allowance. The rest is savings. Then we multiply by the weeks.

---

## ✅ Exercise 7 - Savings with Help

**a) Total money:**
```
18 + 12 = 30 euros
```

**b) How much is missing:**
```
50 - 30 = 20 euros
```

**Answers:** I will have **30 euros** and still need **20 euros**.

**Explanation:** We add what we have with parents' help. Then we see how much is missing for the goal.

---

## ✅ Exercise 8 - The 10-Week Challenge

**a) First 5 weeks:**
```
4 × 5 = 20 euros
```

**b) Last 5 weeks:**
```
6 × 5 = 30 euros
```

**c) Total:**
```
20 + 30 = 50 euros
```

**Answers:** In total I will save **50 euros**.

**Explanation:** We calculate each period separately and then add them. Savings can vary over time!

---

## ✅ Exercise 9 - Have I Reached the Goal?

**a) How much I saved:**
```
4 × 5 = 20 euros
```

**b) Can I buy it?**
```
Ball costs: 18 euros
I have: 20 euros
20 > 18 → YES!
Left over: 20 - 18 = 2 euros
```

**Answers:** I have saved **20 euros**. **Yes**, I can buy it. **2 euros** are left over.

**Explanation:** We multiply weekly savings by the weeks. We compare with the goal. Since 20 > 18, we've reached the goal!

## ✅ Exercise 10 - Sharing with Maria Rita

**a) How much will I pay:**
```
36 ÷ 2 = 18 euros
```

**b) How much more I need:**
```
18 - 12 = 6 euros
```

**c) How many weeks:**
```
6 ÷ 3 = 2 weeks
```

**Explanation:** Sharing expenses is a great way to buy more expensive things! Each pays half.

```
40 ÷ 4 = 10 euros
```

**b) How much stays in the piggy bank:**
```
40 - 10 = 30 euros
```

**Answers:** I will spend **10 euros** and **30 euros** stay in the piggy bank.

**Explanation:** One quarter (1/4) means dividing into 4 equal parts. 40 ÷ 4 = 10.

1. I want to buy: **Skates**
2. It costs: **45 euros**
3. I already have: **15 euros**
