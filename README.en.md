## 📖 About the Project

This repository contains free pedagogical materials to teach **mathematics** and **savings** concepts to children aged 7 to 12. The worksheets were developed to accompany the gift of a piggy bank, transforming it into a practical educational tool.

### 🎯 Objectives

- **Applied mathematics:** Teaching mathematical operations through real-world situations
- **Financial literacy:** Developing concepts of saving, planning, and goal management
- **Autonomy:** Empowering children to set and achieve financial goals
- **Patience and discipline:** Cultivating values like planning, waiting, and delayed gratification
